# bsdlabs infrastructure onboarding
1. Contact a [team member](https://github.com/orgs/bsdlabs/teams/infrastructure)
   
   Please include contact information such as your Discord username, e-mail, areas of expertise and other pertinent information.
2. If your skills are a good match, we will contact you to setup an informal meeting to discuss what needs to be done.
3. Next steps include introduction to infrastructure and setting up access as needed. While waiting for communication from the team, please, take a look at [our commonly used podman commands](https://github.com/bsdlabs/infra/blob/main/podman.md)
