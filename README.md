# bsdlabs infrastructure project

[Team](https://github.com/orgs/bsdlabs/teams/infrastructure)

The infrastructure team's goal is to coordinate and maintain all BSDLabs infrastructure, apps and services. Current infrastructure includes:
* [bsd.to](https://bsd.to) - pastebin
* [BeastieBot](https://github.com/bsdlabs/Beastie-Bot) - Discord bot

Current infrastucture includes 2 Oracle ARM servers with 4 CPUs and 12GB of RAM each. These are located in the AU region of Oracle's infrastructure and are both running FreeBSD. Our goal for current infrastructure includes hosting previously mentioned applications, with redundancy, as well as future projects that BSDLabs may procure.
